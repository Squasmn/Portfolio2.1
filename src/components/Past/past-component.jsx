        <h2>Previous professional life</h2>
        <p>
          Before my venture into webdevelopment, I used to work as a numismatic
          (coin expert) for a well reknown, international auction house in my
          city of origin, DÃ¼sseldorf.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did an apprenticeship as clerk for office management with this
          employer. Thereby already being heavily involved in the auction
          management, for periods leading the department.
        </p>
        <p>
          In consequence, I was offered a permanent position as a numismatic.
          Quickly climbing up the internal ladder, I was soon responsible for
          the entire numismatic department as a stand-in. I was in charge of the
          aquisition of new items, the creation of the auction catalogues and
          for the customer service.
        </p>
        <p>
          I acquired an extra qualification in international marketing and sales
          management, which drew me towards webdevelopment as a new carreer
          path.
